### **Basic Example**

import pandas as pd  
from transition\_pinn import PhysicsInformedTransitionModel, ReEntryPhysics

\# 1\. Initialize physics module and PINN  
physics \= ReEntryPhysics()  
model \= PhysicsInformedTransitionModel(input\_dim=7) \# Assuming 7 input features

\# 2\. Load and prepare your data  
\# This is a placeholder for your data loading and preparation function  
\# df \= pd.read\_csv('your\_data.csv')  
\# X, y, scaler\_x, scaler\_y \= prepare\_dataset(df, physics)

\# 3\. Train the model  
\# trained\_model, losses \= train\_pinn(X, y, physics, epochs=3000)

\# 4\. Make predictions on new data  
\# Example test case: \[Altitude, Velocity, Mach, Nose Radius, etc.\]  
test\_cases \= np.array(\[\[28.0, 6.0, 20.0, 3.2, 0.0, 5.0, 2.3e6\]\])  
critical\_re, n\_factor, transition\_metric \= model.predict(test\_cases)

\# 5\. Use physics module to derive further insights  
transition\_altitude \= physics.find\_transition\_altitude(velocity=6000,   
                                                      length=2.0,   
                                                      Re\_critical=critical\_re)

print(f"Predicted Critical Re: {critical\_re\[0\]\[0\]:.2f} million")  
print(f"Predicted N-Factor: {n\_factor\[0\]\[0\]:.1f}")  
print(f"Transition Metric (Probability): {transition\_metric\[0\]\[0\]\*100:.0f}%")  
print(f"Estimated Transition Altitude: {transition\_altitude:.1f} km")

## **Data Format**

Your input data should be a CSV file with columns similar to the following:

* Altitude (km)  
* Velocity (km/s)  
* Mach number  
* Nose radius (m)  
* Angle of attack (degrees)  
* Effective cone angle (degrees)  
* Transition location (m) (as a target variable)  
* Reynolds number (optional, can be calculated)

## **Methodology**

### **Physics-Based Feature Engineering**

The model enriches the raw input data by creating synthetic features based on physical principles:

* **Vehicle characteristic length** estimated from nose radius (physical scaling).  
* **Wall temperature ratio (**T\_w/T\_e**)** based on thermal physics models.  
* **Pressure gradient estimation** derived from flight dynamics and vehicle shape.  
* **Surface roughness parameter** based on material properties.

### **Physics Modules**

#### **Reynolds Number Calculation**

Calculates the local Reynolds number using atmospheric data and Sutherland's law for viscosity.

def calculate\_reynolds(self, velocity, altitude, length):  
    """Calculates Reynolds number based on atmospheric conditions."""  
    rho \= float(self.rho\_interp(altitude))  \# Density from atmosphere model  
    T \= float(self.T\_interp(altitude))      \# Temperature from atmosphere model  
    mu \= 1.458e-6 \* T\*\*1.5 / (T \+ 110.4)   \# Sutherland's law for viscosity  
    Re \= (rho \* velocity \* length) / mu     \# Navier-Stokes definition  
    return Re

#### **Orr-Sommerfeld Stability Approximation**

The model implements a simplified, parameterized solver for the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which governs the stability of laminar boundary layers to small disturbances.

#### **N-Factor Calculation**

Computes the N-factor, which integrates the spatial growth rates of the most unstable instability waves—a cornerstone of modern transition prediction.

#### **Intermittency Transport**

Models the transport of intermittency (γ), which represents the probability of turbulence at a given point, following the robust approaches used in production CFD codes like ANSYS and OpenFOAM.

### **Neural Network Architecture**

The PINN uses a multi-output design with a shared feature extraction backbone and specialized prediction heads for each physical quantity.

import torch  
import torch.nn as nn

class PhysicsInformedTransitionModel(nn.Module):  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, input\_dim, hidden\_layers=\[64, 64, 32\]):  
        super(PhysicsInformedTransitionModel, self).\_\_init\_\_()  
          
        \# Shared feature extraction layers  
        layers \= \[\]  
        prev\_dim \= input\_dim  
        for i, hidden\_dim in enumerate(hidden\_layers):  
            layers.append(nn.Linear(prev\_dim, hidden\_dim))  
            layers.append(nn.Tanh())  
            prev\_dim \= hidden\_dim  
          
        self.shared\_network \= nn.Sequential(\*layers)  
          
        \# Multiple specialized output heads  
        self.output\_critical\_re \= nn.Linear(prev\_dim, 1\)        \# Critical Reynolds number  
        self.output\_n\_factor \= nn.Linear(prev\_dim, 1\)           \# N-factor  
        self.output\_transition\_metric \= nn.Linear(prev\_dim, 1\)  \# Combined transition metric / probability

### **Physics-Informed Loss Function**

The model employs a sophisticated composite loss function that penalizes deviations from data and enforces physical constraints using automatic differentiation.

def physics\_loss(self, inputs, outputs, physics\_module):  
    \# Ensure inputs are traceable for gradient computation  
    inputs.requires\_grad\_(True)  
      
    critical\_re, n\_factor, transition\_metric \= outputs  
      
    \# Example: Enforce that Reynolds number increases with Mach number (for a given altitude)  
    \# This is a simplified example constraint  
    dRe\_dMach \= torch.autograd.grad(outputs.critical\_re, inputs.Mach,   
                                  grad\_outputs=torch.ones\_like(outputs.critical\_re),  
                                  create\_graph=True, retain\_graph=True)\[0\]  
      
    mach\_constraint\_loss \= torch.relu(-dRe\_dMach).mean()  
      
    \# ... additional constraints for temperature, pressure gradient, roughness, etc.  
      
    total\_physics\_loss \= mach\_constraint\_loss \# \+ other\_constraint\_losses  
    return total\_physics\_loss

## **Mathematical Foundation**

The model is grounded in these fundamental equations of fluid dynamics:

* **Navier-Stokes Equations (Simplified for Reynolds Number)**:Re=μρVL​

* **Orr-Sommerfeld Equation (Linear Stability)**:(∇2−α2)(ϕ′′−α2ϕ)=iαRe\[(U−c)(ϕ′′−α2ϕ)−U′′ϕ\]

* **e^N-factor Method (Transition Prediction)**:N=∫\_x\_0x−α\_i,dx  
* **Intermittency Transport (**γ**\-Re$\_{\\theta}$ model family)**:DtDγ​=P\_γ−E\_γ+∂x\_j∂​\[(ν+σ\_γν\_t​)∂x\_j∂γ​\]

## **Results**

The model provides three complementary predictions, offering a holistic view of the transition process:

1. **Critical Reynolds Number**: The traditional engineering metric for transition onset.  
2. **N-Factor**: A direct measure of disturbance amplification from stability theory.  
3. **Transition Metric**: A learned, combined metric that can be interpreted as a transition probability.

#### **Example Output:**

Case 1:  
  Predicted Critical Re: 2.45 million  
  Predicted Transition Altitude: 28.3 km  
  N-factor: 7.8  
  Transition Probability: 82%

## **Advantages**

* **Physics-Informed**: Goes beyond simple curve fitting by respecting fundamental laws.  
* **Multi-Scale**: Captures both microscopic stability phenomena and macroscopic flight effects.  
* **Extrapolatable**: Physical constraints enable more reliable predictions beyond the training data range.  
* **Interpretable**: Gradient analysis can reveal the learned physical relationships between parameters.  
* **Robust**: Multiple prediction metrics provide a form of built-in cross-validation.

## **Applications**

* Re-entry vehicle design and optimization  
* Thermal Protection System (TPS) sizing
